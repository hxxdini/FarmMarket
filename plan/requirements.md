## Introduction

The Farmer Market Platform is a SaaS solution designed to empower smallholder farmers in Uganda with real-time market information, price data, and agricultural insights. The platform addresses the information gap that prevents farmers from making informed decisions about crop pricing, market timing, and agricultural practices. By providing accessible market intelligence through multiple channels (mobile app, SMS, USSD), the platform aims to increase farmer income, reduce food waste, and strengthen food security across Uganda.
